\section{Introduction, Motivation, and Objectives}

\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dimensionality Reduction definition, goal and applications.
    \item Examples of DR methods.
    \item Key points and limitations of DR methods.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item When the number of individuals is really large, the use of distance matrices is prohibitive.
    \item There are algorithms that extend MDS to the big data setting.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adapt these algorithms to any generic distance-based dimensionality reduction method.
\end{itemize}
