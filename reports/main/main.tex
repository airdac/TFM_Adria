\section*{Acknowledgements}

Even though this master's thesis has been written in a small committee, I would like to appreciate the team my thesis supervisors and I have brought about during this semester. Our weekly video calls have become a space I will fondly remember for a long time. Thank you, Cristian and Pedro, for dedicating your time to help me bring forthward this project every week without fail. I have felt completely at ease under your supervision and you have given me the courage to overcome my recurring fears when I needed it most. I can confidently proclaim that your aid has been essential to bring this thesis to a success. Thank you.

\begin{abstract}
    Dimensionality reduction aims to project a dataset into a low-dimensional space. Many techniques have been proposed, most of them based on the inter-individual distance matrix. When the number of individuals is really large, the use of full distance matrices is prohibitive because of their quadratic memory complexity. There are algorithms that extend classical multidimensional scaling (a long-established dimensionality reduction method based on distances) to the big data setting. In this TFM, we adapt these algorithms to any generic distance-based dimensionality reduction method.
