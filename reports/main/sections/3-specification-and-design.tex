\section{Specification and Design of the Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Jusitfy D\&C in non-linear DR methods. Most techniques shown in \verb|bigmds| are not generalizable to non-linear DR methods different to Isomap (since it uses MDS). However, D\&C and recurrence can work with more general algorithms. Finally, we chose D\&C because recurrence can create very small partitions that may be problematic.
    \item D\&C algorithm
