\section{Analysis of Sustainability and Ethical Implications}

\textbf{DESCRIPTION OF THIS SECTION FROM THE REGULATION:}

It must include an analysis of the impact of the following gender-related technical aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item issues related to data management and analysis
    \item issues related to equity, where possible biases are identified and assessed both in the data and in the processes carried out in relation to data management and analysis
    \item actions carried out to eliminate or mitigate such biases
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ACTUAL CONTENT:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item D\&C can be used in normal computers, while traditional DR methods require supercomputers to work on big datasets. Hence, we will reduce computing emissions.
    \item Maybe (it needs testing) DR methods could emphasize biases in the data. This happens because when projecting only a few coordinates, small clusters could be left behind in the remaining not projected coordinates and do not show in the final embedding. Hence, in theory, small communities could become invisible.
\end{itemize}
